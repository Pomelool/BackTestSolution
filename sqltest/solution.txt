Problem 1
SELECT CONCAT_WS(" ", `first_name`, `last_name`) AS `full name`, player_id AS 'id', FK_position as 'position', signed_date, COUNT(goal_id) AS 'total goals'
FROM `hockey`.`player`
JOIN `hockey`.`team` ON `hockey`.`player`.FK_team_id = `hockey`.`team`.team_id
LEFT JOIN `hockey`.`goal` ON `hockey`.`goal`.FK_player_id = `hockey`.`player`.player_id
WHERE retired_date IS NULL
AND name = 'dallas pengiuns';

Problem 2
SELECT timestamp AS 'Top 5 days of goals'
FROM `hockey`.`goal`
GROUP BY timestamp
ORDER BY COUNT(goal_id) desc
LIMIT 5;

Problem 3
SELECT CONCAT_WS(" ", `first_name`, `last_name`) AS `full name`, player_id AS 'id', name AS 'team', DATEDIFF(retired_date, signed_date) AS 'career length(Days)'
FROM `hockey`.`player`

WHERE retired_date IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY team, `full name` desc;

Problem 4
SELECT CONCAT_WS(" ", `first_name`, `last_name`) AS `full name`, FK_position AS 'position', COUNT(goal_id) AS 'total goals'
FROM `hockey`.`player`
LEFT JOIN `hockey`.`goal` ON `hockey`.`player`.player_id = `hockey`.`goal`.FK_player_id
JOIN `hockey`.`team` ON `hockey`.`player`.FK_team_id = `hockey`.`team`.team_id
WHERE retired_date IS NULL
GROUP BY player_id
ORDER BY name, position, `total goals` desc;

Problem 5
SELECT FK_position AS 'Position With Most Goals in 2015'
FROM `hockey`.`goal`
JOIN `hockey`.`player` ON `hockey`.`goal`.FK_player_id = `hockey`.`player`.player_id
WHERE LEFT(timestamp, 4) = 2015
GROUP BY FK_position
ORDER BY COUNT(goal_id) desc
LIMIT 1;

Problem 6
SELECT name AS 'the top 10 teams who have scored the most goals'
FROM `hockey`.`goal`
JOIN `hockey`.`player` ON `hockey`.`goal`.FK_player_id = `hockey`.`player`.player_id
JOIN `hockey`.`team` ON `hockey`.`team`.team_id = `hockey`.`player`.FK_team_id
WHERE LEFT(timestamp, 4) BETWEEN 2012 AND 2016
GROUP BY team_id

LIMIT 10;

Problem 7
SELECT CONCAT_WS(" ", `first_name`, `last_name`) AS `full name`, COUNT(goal_id) AS 'total goals'
FROM `hockey`.`player`
JOIN `hockey`.`team` ON `hockey`.`player`.FK_team_id = `hockey`.`team`.team_id

Problem 8
SELECT name AS 'the team who have scored the most goalie goals'
FROM `hockey`.`goal`
JOIN `hockey`.`player` ON `hockey`.`goal`.FK_player_id = `hockey`.`player`.player_id
JOIN `hockey`.`team` ON `hockey`.`team`.team_id = `hockey`.`player`.FK_team_id
WHERE FK_position = 'goalie'
GROUP BY team_id
ORDER BY COUNT(goal_id) desc
LIMIT 1;

Problem 9
CREATE INDEX IX_player_lastname
ON `hockey`.`player` (last_name);

Problem 10
Add a teamid column (INT) in goal table so that there is no need to involve player table to conduct team goal analysis. 
For example for question 6, we don't need to join player table any more.

Problem 11
CREATE INDEX IX_player_composite
ON `hockey`.`player` (first_name ASC, last_name DESC, FK_position ASC, signed_date DESC);
